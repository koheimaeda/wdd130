      <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Kohei Maeda" width="200">
      <p>Hello everyone!  My name is Kohei Maeda from Japan. I have lived in Japan all my life except for two
        years when I served my mission in Hawaii. I had great experiences in Hawaii serving amazing people.
        After I finished my mission, I came back to Japan and went back to my university. After I graduated
        from there, I got a job in Tokyo and got married. I have two gaughters and a son. I love to go cycling 
        with them. I had been always wanted to go to Brigham Young University like many of my friends. I got 
        information about BYU PathwayConnect and decided to partipate in this program. I finished all the
        courses of it last December, and finally I got accepted to BYU-Idaho as an online student.
